## 🎬 Quick Start Commands

### Just Build Everything:
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\tap45\OneDrive\Desktop\stuff\hyper-ahs"
py run_all_daw_phases.py
```

### Just Build Phase 1:

cd "c:\Users\tap45\OneDrive\Documents\Overlay Data\Tap-Daw-main\phases\daw_phase_1_session_core"
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Just Run Phase 1:
```powershell
.\phases\daw_phase_1_session_core\build\Release\TapDAW_Phase1.exe
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

All terminal and execution issues have been documented in `BUILD_NOTES.md`. The VS Code tasks are configured to bypass these issues automatically.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor Progress**: Watch `hyper-ahs.log` for Hyper-AHS output
2. **Checkpoints**: `.checkpoints/` folders are backups - don't delete
3. **Parallel Builds**: Use `--parallel` flag with cmake for faster builds
4. **Long Paths**: If Windows complains, enable long paths (see BUILD_NOTES.md)
