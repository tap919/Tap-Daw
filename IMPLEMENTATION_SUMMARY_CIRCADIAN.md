# Implementation Summary: Circadian Phase GUI

## Issue Reference
GitHub Issue #3: "GUI exposes phase and override reason capture"

## Requirements Met ✅

### 1. Real-time Phase Display
✅ **Implemented**: The GUI displays the current circadian phase (LEARN/SHIP/REST) in real-time based on the time of day.

**Evidence:**
```
===========================================
        CIRCADIAN PHASE STATUS
===========================================
Current Phase: LEARN
Override Active: NO (automatic mode)
===========================================
```

### 2. Override Controls
✅ **Implemented**: Users can trigger phase override actions through an interactive menu system.

**Evidence:**
```
--- Phase Override Controls ---
1. Override to LEARN phase
2. Override to SHIP phase
3. Override to REST phase
4. Clear override (return to automatic)
5. Return to main menu
-------------------------------
```

### 3. Override Reason Capture
✅ **Implemented**: When an override is triggered, the system prompts the user to capture and log the override reason.

**Evidence:**
```
Enter the reason for this override:
> Critical bug fix needed for production release

✓ Phase override applied successfully!
  From: LEARN
  To: SHIP
  Reason: Critical bug fix needed for production release
```

### 4. Dual Logging System
✅ **Implemented**: Override reasons are recorded in both the alignment ledger and telemetry systems.

**Alignment Ledger Evidence:**
```
[2025-10-30 13:02:48] Override: LEARN -> SHIP | Reason: Critical bug fix needed for production release
```

**Telemetry Evidence:**
```
[2025-10-30 13:02:48] PHASE_OVERRIDE | From: LEARN | To: SHIP | Reason: Critical bug fix needed for production release
```

## Technical Architecture

### Components Created

1. **CircadianPhaseManager** (`include/CircadianPhaseManager.h`, `src/CircadianPhaseManager.cpp`)
   - Tracks current phase state
   - Determines automatic phase based on time of day
   - Manages override state and reasons

2. **AlignmentLedger** (`include/AlignmentLedger.h`, `src/AlignmentLedger.cpp`)
   - Records structured override entries
   - Persists to `alignment_ledger.log`
   - Maintains in-memory history

3. **TelemetrySystem** (`include/TelemetrySystem.h`, `src/TelemetrySystem.cpp`)
   - Comprehensive event logging
   - Persists to `telemetry.log`
   - Tracks GUI lifecycle and all override events

4. **CircadianGUI** (`include/CircadianGUI.h`, `src/CircadianGUI.cpp`)
   - Text-based interactive interface
   - Menu-driven navigation
   - Integrates all components

### Phase Schedule

- **LEARN** (8am - 2pm): Learning, creativity, experimentation
- **SHIP** (2pm - 8pm): Production, execution, delivery
- **REST** (8pm - 8am): Recovery, reflection, rest

## Testing

### Test Suite
- **Location**: `tests/test_circadian_phase.cpp`
- **Coverage**: All core components
- **Result**: 100% pass rate

**Test Output:**
```
=== Running Circadian Phase System Tests ===

Testing phaseToString utility...
  ✓ All phase strings correct

Testing CircadianPhaseManager...
  ✓ Initial state is not overridden
  ✓ Current phase: LEARN
  ✓ Override to LEARN phase successful
  ✓ Clear override successful

Testing AlignmentLedger...
  ✓ Override entry recorded
  ✓ Ledger flushed to disk

Testing TelemetrySystem...
  ✓ Override logged to telemetry
  ✓ General event logged
  ✓ Telemetry flushed to disk

===========================================
All tests passed successfully! ✓
===========================================
```

## Usage Example

```
MyDAW - Digital Audio Workstation with Circadian Phase Management

╔════════════════════════════════════╗
║      MyDAW - Circadian Phase      ║
╚════════════════════════════════════╝
1. Display current phase
2. Override phase
3. Clear override
4. Exit
────────────────────────────────────
Select option: 2

--- Phase Override Controls ---
1. Override to LEARN phase
2. Override to SHIP phase
3. Override to REST phase
4. Clear override (return to automatic)
5. Return to main menu
-------------------------------
Select phase to override to: 2
