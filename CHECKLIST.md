## Files to Check

| File | Purpose | When to Check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `hyper_ahs.log` | Execution progress | During run |
| `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` | This session's work | Anytime |
| `BUILD_NOTES.md` | Troubleshooting | If errors occur |
| `README_NEXT_SESSION.md` | Quick reference | When starting |

## Expected Output

After ~1 hour, you'll have:

```
âœ… phases/daw_phase_1_session_core/build/Release/TapDAW_Phase1.exe
âœ… phases/ss/build/Release/TapDAW_Phase3_AutoXfade.exe
âœ… phases/04_playback/build/Release/*.exe
âœ… phases/07_fl_midi/build/Release/*.exe
âœ… phases/build/Release/ClapHostTest.exe
âœ… AUTO_FROM_HYPER_AHS/ (all phase docs)
âœ… Complete, working DAW!
```

---

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. Check `hyper_ahs.log` for errors
2. Read `BUILD_NOTES.md` section matching the error
3. Run individual phases manually:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\tap45\OneDrive\Desktop\stuff\hyper-ahs"
   py run_daw_phase1.py
   ```

---

## Testing Your DAW

After build completes:

```powershell
# Launch Phase 1
.\phases\daw_phase_1_session_core\build\Release\TapDAW_Phase1.exe
```

**What to test:**
- [ ] Window opens (Tap DAW - Session Core)
- [ ] Demo session shows 2 tracks
- [ ] Timeline displays clips
- [ ] File â†’ Save As works
- [ ] File â†’ Open loads saved file
- [ ] Zoom controls work

## That's It!

Everything is configured and ready to run automatically.
